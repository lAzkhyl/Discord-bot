Create a complete Discord.py bot. The bot must consist of two files: `main.py` and `keep_alive.py`.

The bot's primary feature is a leveling system, but with a key requirement: **XP and levels must be tracked separately for two different roles**, "Role A" and "Role B".

-----

### `main.py` Requirements

1.  **Libraries:** Use `discord.py` (with `commands.Bot`), `replit-db` for the database, `os` for the token, and `time` for the cooldown.
2.  **Intents:** Ensure correct Gateway Intents are enabled, specifically `Intents.members = True` and `Intents.message_content = True`.
3.  **Configuration:** Use placeholder variables at the top of the file for `ROLE_A_ID` and `ROLE_B_ID` (e.g., `ROLE_A_ID = 12345...`).
4.  **Database (`replit-db`):**
      * Data must be stored using the `user_id` as the primary key.
      * The data structure must be a nested dictionary to store the separate role data, like this:
        ```json
        {
          "USER_ID_123": {
            "role_a": {"xp": 50, "level": 1},
            "role_b": {"xp": 120, "level": 2}
          }
        }
        ```
5.  **`on_message` Logic (Critical):**
      * **Separate Leveling Logic:** When a user sends a message:
          * Check if they have `ROLE_A_ID`. If yes, add XP to their `role_a` data.
          * Check if they have `ROLE_B_ID`. If yes, add XP to their `role_b` data.
          * If they have **both** roles, they must gain XP for **both** categories independently.
      * **Efficiency & Cooldown Logic:**
          * Implement a **global XP cooldown** per user to prevent spam and database overload.
          * Use a Python dictionary (e.g., `user_cooldowns = {}`) to track the `time.time()` of the last message that received XP.
          * Set the cooldown to 60 seconds. A user should only be able to gain XP **once every 60 seconds**.
          * The bot should only perform a **maximum of 1 database read and 1 database write** per user within this 60-second cooldown period, even if they are gaining XP for both roles at the same time.
6.  **Level Up Logic:**
      * Create a helper function `xp_for_next_level(level)` (e.g., `return 100 * (level + 1)`).
      * When XP is added, check if the user has enough to level up in either (or both) role categories.
      * If they level up, send a public congratulations message that **specifies which role** they leveled up in (e.g., "Congrats @User, you reached Level 5 for **Role A**\!").
7.  **`!level` Command:**
      * Create a `!level` command.
      * The bot must respond with a clean **Discord Embed**.
      * This Embed must clearly display the user's current statistics (Level, XP, and XP needed for next level) for **both "Role A" and "Role B"** separately.
8.  **Bot Execution:**
      * The bot must read its token from Replit Secrets (`os.environ['DISCORD_TOKEN']`).
      * It must import and call the `keep_alive()` function from the other file before `bot.run()`.
